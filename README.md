This is where I will be uploading some of my Python projects while I learn.

To use IP Finder, add a name and an ip address to iplist.txt however you want as long as it's on the same line. Run IP Finder by running "python ipfinder.py" or "py ipfinder.py" in the terminal

To use dvdsearch you can run it by running "python dvdsearch.py" or "py dvdsearch.py" and then just search the database. To add more dvd's you have to edit the dvds.txt file and add more in the same format that I did.

To use login you can just run it and select which option to use. You must have a file named items.json in the same directory. Download mine or look at it as an example.

To use openweather you just run it will ask for the city and country to search.

To use hostupdater run it with admin (sudo python hostupdater.py) and it will ask what kind of blocking to add. Like blocking trackers and ads
